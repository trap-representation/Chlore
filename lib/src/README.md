This directory contains the source of the various objects present in the standard library.

Certain objects cannot be written in Sasm itself, and need to be written in a different language; that's why those objects aren't put here, because they may vary across implementations.

Only those objects that can be written in a *strictly standard conforming* way in Sasm, are present here.
