All the object files and header files in here are strictly standard conforming.

Since these object files are strictly standard conforming, these will work with any environment that a particular implementation of Chlore can target (at least as long as the environment supports the functionalities that the libraries expect the environment to support).

NOTE Even though everything here is *strictly standard conforming*, these are *not* necessarily portable across different implementations.

The header files and the source of the object files in the standard library are put here just to demonstrate how those are created, and implementations may define their own version of the objects and headers.
